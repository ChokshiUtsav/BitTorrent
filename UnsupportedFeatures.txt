What will not be supported in near future (i.e. 3 months) :

1) uTP (uTorrent Protocol)
   An alternative to TCP protocol for communication between peers.
   Why ? It requires , writing protocol from scratch (i.e. desigining packet format).
   More on :http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html

2) Magnet links
   An alternate to download a torrent without even downloading torrent file
   Why ? Every torrent that has magnet link , also has .torrent file. So this is an add-on and not neccessary feature.

3) UDP based trackers
   Requires communication to be haapended with tracker using UDP protocol
   Why ?  Yet to figure out format of UDP request and response.
